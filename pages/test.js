                All growing businesses need capital. At times, it can be

                  When a business experiences softness in the market, it can be
                  difficult for management to work with existing lenders. Not
                  only must a management team continue to operate the business
                  in a tough environment, but it must also be concerned about
                  its bank! Catalina can help. We are owned and operated by
                  former bankers and are experienced in working through
                  challenging loan situations. Whether you simply need another
                  voice in the room or need Catalina to take the lead on a full
                  restructuring process, we help companies navigate the
                  difficulties associated with loan modification and
                  restructuring.

                Management teams get pulled in many different directions. It can
                be difficult to prioritize your bank reporting over other
                operational demands of your business, which can cause tension
                between you and your lender. Catalina can help. We do the heavy
                lifting when it comes to your bankâ€™s financial reporting,
                compliance, and borrowing base requirements. Also, we assist
                management teams in identifying performance trends, addressing
                liquidity constraints, and remaining in full compliance of all
                loan reporting requirements.
